    "Deep learning develops at breakneck speed, with new models, techniques, and tricks constantly appearing. As a result, it is easy to get stuck on something less-than-optimal when using deep learning to solve a particular set of problems while also being in danger of getting lost in minor technical details when constructing models for concrete tasks. Therefore, the fastai deep learning library [@howard2020fastai; @howard2020deep] provides both a high-level API that automatically incorporates many established best practices and a low-level API in which one can modify details related to model architectures, training strategies, data augmentation, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "fastai is a general deep learning library built on top of PyTorch. However, medical imaging has a variety of domain-specific demands, including medical imaging formats, data storage and transfer, data labeling procedures, domain-specific data augmentation, and evaluation methods. MONAI Core [@monai] and TorchIO [@perez2021torchio] target deep learning in healthcare imaging, incorporating multiple best practices. MONAI Core, the primary library of Project MONAI, is built on top of PyTorch and provides domain-specific functionalities for medical imaging, including network architectures, metrics, and loss functions. \n",
    "TorchIO is a Python-based open-source library for efficiently loading, preprocessing, and augmenting 3D medical images. \n",
    "\n",
    "Three key features impacting the performance of a deep learning system are the network architecture, training methods, and data [@woo2023convnext]. Our combination of fastai, MONAI Core, and TorchIO into fastMONAI, together with custom-made modules like our `MedDataset`, makes it possible to easily construct, train, and use powerful models with a range of different architectures for a variety of medical imaging tasks, while using established best practices for training, for reading data, for performing data augmentation, and for other domain-specific capabilities incorporated into these three libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The library is developed at The Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization Centre (MMIV), which is part of the Department of Radiology at Haukeland University Hospital. One of the center's key objectives is to develop new quantitative methods for high-field MRI, CT, and hybrid PET/CT/MR in preclinical and clinical settings, aiming to improve decision-making and patient care. fastMONAI supports such efforts by easing the entry for new practitioners into medical AI and making it possible to quickly construct good baseline models while still being flexible enough to enable further optimizations."
