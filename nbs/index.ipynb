Drawing upon the strengths of fastai, MONAI, and TorchIO, fastMONAI simplifies the use of advanced techniques for tasks like classification, regression, and segmentation. The library's design addresses domain-specific demands while promoting best practices, facilitating efficient model development. It offers newcomers an easier entry into the field while keeping the option to make advanced, lower-level customizations if needed. This paper describes the library's design, impact, limitations, and plans for future work.}\n",
