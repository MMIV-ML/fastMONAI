A low-code Python-based open source deep learning library built on top
of [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai),
[MONAI](https://monai.io/), [TorchIO](https://torchio.readthedocs.io/),
and [Imagedata](https://imagedata.readthedocs.io/).

fastMONAI simplifies the use of state-of-the-art deep learning
techniques in 3D medical image analysis for solving classification,
regression, and segmentation tasks. fastMONAI provides the users with
functionalities to step through data loading, preprocessing, training,
and result interpretations.

<b>Note:</b> This documentation is also available as interactive
notebooks.

## Requirements

- **Python:** 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 (Python 3.11 recommended)
- **GPU:** CUDA-compatible GPU recommended for training (CPU supported
  for inference)

# Installation

## Environment setup (recommended)

We recommend using a conda environment to avoid dependency conflicts:

`conda create -n fastmonai python=3.11`

`conda activate fastmonai`

## Quick Install [(PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/fastMONAI/)

`pip install fastMONAI`

## Development install [(GitHub)](https://github.com/MMIV-ML/fastMONAI)

If you want to install an editable version of fastMONAI for development:

    git clone https://github.com/MMIV-ML/fastMONAI
    cd fastMONAI

    # Create development environment
    conda create -n fastmonai-dev python=3.11
    conda activate fastmonai-dev

    # Install in development mode
    pip install -e '.[dev]'

# Getting started

The best way to get started using fastMONAI is to read our
[paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2665963823001203)
and dive into our beginner-friendly [video
tutorial](https://fastmonai.no/tutorial_beginner_video). For a deeper
understanding and hands-on experience, our comprehensive instructional
notebooks will walk you through model training for various tasks like
classification, regression, and segmentation. See the docs at
https://fastmonai.no for more information.
